# TKG Lab Foundation

Execute the `Foudational Lab Setup` from [tkg-lab](https://github.com/Pivotal-Field-Engineering/tkg-lab).

Note: I tested this with 6 worker nodes in the Shared Services cluster and 4 worker nodes in the Workload cluster.  Worker nodes were 2 core, 8 GB.

Then exercise the following bonus labs...

1. [Deploy Harbor Image Registry to Shared Services Cluster](https://github.com/Pivotal-Field-Engineering/tkg-lab/blob/master/docs/bonus-labs/harbor.md)
2. [Deploy Concourse to Shared Services Cluster](https://github.com/Pivotal-Field-Engineering/tkg-lab/blob/master/docs/bonus-labs/concourse.md)
3. [Deploy Kubeapps to Shared Services Cluster](https://github.com/Pivotal-Field-Engineering/tkg-lab/blob/master/docs/bonus-labs/kubeapps.md)

## Go to Next Step
